Upgrade this app to rails 8, making sure you don't delete any of my custom app configuration from config files (production.rb, development.rb, application.rb, etc). Only change things necessitated by an upgrade from rails 7.1 to rails 8
Once you've completed the upgrade, run the following commands, modifying the code until they all run successfully:
- `bundle update datadog rollbar standard bundler-audit brakeman dotenv-rails`
- `bundle exec bundle audit check --update`
- `bundle exec brakeman --ensure-latest -A -q --no-pager`
- `bundle exec rspec`
- `bundle exec standardrb --fix`
